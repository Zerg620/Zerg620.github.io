  I am Zerg620. You may have seen me around the internet playing video games. After playing video games for 18 years, I decided that
  I wanted to give back and make video games since I loved computers, math, science, and games. It's been rough having to learn
  how to program computers with no prior experience, but the tutorials and friends I have found have made it easier.
  #Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
  #line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
  #Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://yourdomain.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
