I've been taking classes at Codecademy and now I can do more amazing things with Javascript!

<html>
<body>

<script>
var confirmResult = confirm("I can do more things now that I'm accustomed to programming websites.\nGet Ready!");
if(confirmResult==true){
  txt = Here we go!
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
