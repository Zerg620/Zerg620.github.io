This means that I can post links to all my works, and even host all my works on a website! That's so cool and helpful!<br>
Be sure to extract the file from the zip folder and read the README.txt file.

Feel free to suggest educational games and tools! I'll most definitely try to make them! Maybe I can make you a custom-tailored tool!
